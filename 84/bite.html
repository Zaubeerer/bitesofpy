<p>Complete <code>flatten</code> that takes a list of lists (which can have lists ad infinitum) and flatten them into a one dimensional list.</p><p>So this input:<pre>
[1, [2, 3], [4, 5, [6, 7, [8, 9, 10]]]]
</pre>... should generate this output: <pre>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</pre></p><p>Make sure you support both <code>list</code>s and <code>tuple</code>s. You probably want to use recursion here ... have fun!</p>
