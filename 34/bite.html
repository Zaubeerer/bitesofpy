<p>This Bite is about implementing a <code>User</code> class that keeps track of <i>karma</i> points received (Bite idea came from <a href="https://github.com/pybites/karmabot" target="_blank">our karmabot</a>).</p><p>As it is an <i>Advanced</i> Bite we have you look at the tests to figure out the implementation, but we will say that the class uses 3 <i>magic/special/dunder</i> methods and 3 <i>properties</i>.</p><p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
